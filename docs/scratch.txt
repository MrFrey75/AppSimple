Scratch pad notes and experiments. 

  1. Commit and push any pending changes on the current branch (UserCLI)
  2. Switch the root branch
  2. Create a new branch called `MvvmApp`
  3. Create the AppSimple.MvvmApp WPF application
  4. The app should have:
     - A public landing page on startup
     - A navigation bar at the top
     - On the left of the nav bar: options that change based on role/permissions
     - On the right there should be a username/password/login section
  5. Update all documentation when complete
  6. Commit and push all changes to the `MvvmApp` 

1. Push and commit all current code.  
2. Create a new branch off MvvmApp called ThemeSelection
3. Switch the the new branch.
4. Add add the ability to set the color scheme based on 5 diffent common thmese choices
5. Commit and push resp 


API howto

1. Commit and push any pending changes on the current branch
2. Switch the root branch
3. Create a new branch called `WebApi`
4. Create the AppSimple.WebApi ASP.NET Core Web API application
5. The API should have:
         - A /api endpoint that returns a simple JSON response (e.g. `{ "message": "Hello, World!" }`)
         - A /api/auth/login endpoint that accepts a username and password, validates them against a hardcoded user, and returns a JWT token if valid
         - A /api/public endpoint that is accessible without authentication and returns a message indicating it's a public endpoint
         - A /api/protected endpoint that requires a valid JWT token to access and returns a message indicating the user is authenticated
         - A /api/admin endpoint that requires a valid JWT token with the "Admin" role to access and returns a message indicating the user is an admin
         - A /api/refresh endpoint that accepts a valid JWT token and returns a new token with an extended expiration time
         - Implement proper error handling and return appropriate HTTP status codes for invalid requests, authentication failures, and authorization failures
         - Health check endpoint at /api/health that returns the status of the API (e.g. database connectivity, uptime, etc.)
         - Use in-memory storage for user credentials and token management for simplicity (no database integration required
6. Use the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` package for JWT authentication
7. Use a hardcoded user with the following credentials for testing:
         - Username: `apiuser`
         - Password: `Test@1234`
         - Role: `Admin`
8. Test the API using a tool like Postman or curl to ensure all endpoints are working as expected
9. Update all documentation when complete
